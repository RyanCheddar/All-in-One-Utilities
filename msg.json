"message":"iOS 13 Developer Beta 1 was released today, and while Shortcuts had some very nice updates, some shortcuts became very broken. One of them is All-in-One Utilities.\n\nDue to All-in-One Utilities’ massive size, it will definitely not be able to run smoothly on the new Shortcuts app. Currently on the new Shortcuts app, All-in-One Utilities has a 30% chance of freezing the app, 60% chance of lagging so badly the shortcut becomes unusable and 10% chance you can even open an utility. (All the technology debt in the shortcut finally cane back to bite my butt lol)\n\nRight now, there are three options: 1. Rewrite All-in-One Utilities into a new shortcut (Features like Cronios integration and Modern Menu will be pushed back, but this is going to make the shortcut way smoother and way more pleasant, especially when iOS 13 is no longer in beta) | 2. Attempt to update All-in-One Utilities (Likely not gonna work) | 3. Abandon All-in-One Utilities (:/)\n\nI really want to see what you guys think, so please go to the poll and tell me which option do you think would be the best.\n\nTo go to the poll page, press “Yes”.
