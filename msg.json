"message":"After the poll, I have decided that All-in-One Utilities will be rewritten into MyUtility and MyUtility Core. The new “two shortcut design” should hopefully make the shortcut run way smoother. Because this is gonna be a rewrite, your data will be lost, but I’ll make a transfer tool for the people who uses Scenarios and File Vault.\n\nAnother thing to mention: Check for Updates 2.0 is now included in version 55.4, if you install the update though you will lose access to iTweak. Huge thanks to D3W10 (creator of Utilities Menu, check his shortcut out!)",
